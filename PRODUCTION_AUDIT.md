# MoviesHub Production Audit

## Executive summary
MoviesHub is a polished demo OTT front-end with a strong visual design and a reasonably complete Prisma schema, but it is not yet production-ready. The app has many demo/mock flows and several auth, admin, payment, storage, and access-control gaps that must be addressed before deployment.

## Scope reviewed
- app routes and pages
- UI components and forms
- Prisma schema and data models
- environment template
- existing quality configs
- assistant recommendation logic
- current production documents already in repo

## Current status by domain

### 1. Authentication and authorization
Status: Incomplete
- User/login/register forms are present, but they do not submit to a real server action or API route.
- No real session management is implemented.
- No server-side token/session validation is present.
- No admin/user route protection exists.
- Role-based access control is only defined in Prisma schema, not enforced in the app.

### 2. Database and validation
Status: Partially complete
- Prisma schema is rich and structured.
- Some indexes/uniqueness constraints exist.
- There is no centralized DB service layer for app queries and mutations.
- Input validation is present only on client form components, not enforced server-side for all routes and APIs.
- No consistent API error contract is defined.

### 3. Movie and content access workflow
Status: Partial
- Movie listing/detail/watch pages exist.
- Premium gating is present on the UI, but there is no proper server-side access check for premium-only content.
- Video access relies on mock/demo data and local toggles rather than real signed URLs.
- License expiry logic is modeled in Prisma but not applied to access decisions in a central service.

### 4. Payment and subscription
Status: Incomplete
- Subscription page exists.
- Payment provider abstraction is partially present in `lib/payments`, but not tied to secure server-side verification.
- No webhook verification is implemented.
- No server-side secret enforcement is present.

### 5. AI recommendation engine
Status: Partial
- Assistant page and recommendation logic exist.
- Recommendation scoring is local and demo-based.
- No production AI provider abstraction is present.
- No fallback service contract exists for production AI.

### 6. Admin & operational features
Status: Incomplete
- Admin pages are not present as production routes.
- No secure admin dashboard or role-gated admin APIs.
- No audit log placeholder is wired into admin operations.

### 7. Error handling and UX resilience
Status: Partial
- Loading and error states exist for the assistant page.
- Not-found and unauthorized pages are missing.
- Global error boundary is missing.
- Empty states are incomplete in key flows.

### 8. Security posture
Status: Incomplete
- No verified auth middleware or RBAC enforcement.
- No rate-limit interfaces for auth, AI, or payment endpoints.
- No server-side secret validation pattern.
- No file/URL sanitization enforcement in app flows.
- No explicit audit logging or sanitization of user-generated content.

### 9. Production deployment readiness
Status: Not ready
- No full deployment pipeline or hosting config is implemented.
- No production video storage/CDN setup is implemented.
- No monitoring abstraction is configured.
- No production error tracking is wired up.

## Findings checklist
- [x] Basic app shell and routes exist
- [x] Prisma schema is defined and reasonably complete
- [x] Environment template exists
- [x] AI assistant exists
- [x] Subscription and auth UX exists
- [ ] Real auth and session flow
- [ ] Protected admin and user routes
- [ ] Server-side validation and APIs
- [ ] Payment verification + webhooks
- [ ] Real video access protection
- [ ] Production-grade monitoring and logging
- [ ] CI and automated test pipeline

## Required environment variables
- DATABASE_URL
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
- RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
- RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- AI_API_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- STORAGE_BUCKET
- STORAGE_ENDPOINT
- STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY
- STORAGE_SECRET_KEY

## Security risks
- Mock auth flows can be accidentally deployed as real auth.
- Client-side toggles for premium access do not enforce server-side authorization.
- No server-side checks prevent unauthorized admin actions.
- No rate limiting or secret guarding in auth/payment/AI operations.
- Private video URLs and media access are not yet production secured.

## Recommended next steps
1. Implement real auth with Prisma + NextAuth or equivalent server session strategy.
2. Add protected middleware and server-side RBAC enforcement.
3. Replace mock data calls with server access layers.
4. Add validation and JSON error handling for every API route.
5. Add secure payment and media service integrations.
6. Add tests and CI before production deployment.

## Production completion status
Not yet production-ready.
